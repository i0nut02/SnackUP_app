# SnackUP_app
A web app implementation of one of my projects in high school

## Setup
If you have already installed `python` and `pip` you have just to run the following command:
```
pip install django
```

Move into `SnackUP/` directory and run the following command (If it doesn't work try python2 or python3 instead of python):
```
python manage.py runserver
```
Now you can open any of your browser and enter this url `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
